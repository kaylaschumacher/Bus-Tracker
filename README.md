# Real Time Bus Tracker

## What is it?
This is an assignment I completed for the MIT xPro-MERN course. In this exercise we tracked the route of a bus and a marker was placed at each bus top.

## How to Run?
To run this code, fork and clone this repository. Run the index.html file. All additional files are included in the download.

## Future Improvments?
An additional feature this project could include is the time it takes to get to each bus stop.
